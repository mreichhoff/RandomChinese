# RandomChinese
A simple, frequency-weighted random Chinese generator for use in classrooms or self-study.

The tool has 3 modes:
* Syllables: for beginners, random syllables are presented, weighted by frequency. Particularly useful for early classes: the student can read out each syllable and be judged by their teacher.
* Hanzi: random characters are presented, along with pronunciation, weighted by frequency.
* Words: random words are presented, along with pronunciation and definitions, weighted by frequency.

In all cases, tones are indicated by color.

Use the keyboard or click or tap anywhere for the next random bit of Chinese. You can also filter by frequency, to prevent extremely common words like çš„ from showing up too often.
